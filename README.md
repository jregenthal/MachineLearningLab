# MachineLearningLab

The goal of this project is to predict the risk for drug consumption based on psychological factors using Bayesian Networks. The main analysis consists of the comparison of a package for discrete Bayesian Networks and a from-scratch implementation for discrete as well as continuous variables. The inconsistency of the results for the most part can be traced back to differences in the algorithms, i.e. A* algorithm \& Loopy Belief Propagation in the package, and Hill Climbing and Enumeration algorithm in the from-scratch implementation, as well as the small data set size.
